# moodaily

This is my Final Project for SWE6623 Software Engineering. I built a web application that 
allows users to describe their mood for the day as well as the activities conducted.
For this project, PHP, MySQL, and APIs such as OpenWeatherMap and Calendar were used to
enhance the project and fulfill the project requirements.

##index.html

First, you will be landed to the folder and once clicked, you will be directed to index.html.
This file is supposed to have pictures, but due to PHP, it failed to show them.

##home.php

Here, you can view the weather in your current location as well as the calendar. Here is where
you can input your mood and daily activities. Due to limited time, I was unable to display them
in the calendar, however, they are saved in the database.

##login/signup.php

Here, you can either login or signup into the system. Due to technical difficulties, the username
cannot be displayed onto home.php (which is where you see the error next to logout.php). All data
is also stored in the database.
