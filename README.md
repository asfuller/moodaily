# moodaily
This is my Final Project for SWE6623 Software Engineering. I built a web application that 
allows users to describe their mood for the day as well as the activities conducted.
For this project, PHP, MySQL, and APIs such as OpenWeatherMap and Calendar were used to
enhance the project and fulfill the project requirements.
